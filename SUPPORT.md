## Servicing

Approvals has a lifecycle. A lifecycle begins when a project/service is released and ends when it's no longer supported. Knowing key dates in this lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or make other changes to your software. This project/service is governed by the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy).

## Release Types

Microsoft produces **Current**, **Maintenance**, and **Community** releases for this project, which are defined as:

- **Current**  releases include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. These releases are a good choice for applications in active development, giving you access to the latest features and improvements. You need to upgrade to later releases more often to stay in support. Current releases are typically supported for 3 months after a subsequent Current or LTS release.
- **Maintenance** releases are in the last stage of the lifecycle. During Maintenance, a release will receive security updates and critical functionality issues.
- **Community** releases are not officially supported by Microsoft and are actively maintained by the community and third-parties. In most cases they are in active development and bugs are addressed where possible.

Current and Maintenance releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security or reliability. You must stay up to date with the latest patches to qualify for support.

## End of support

End of support refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides fixes, updates, or online technical assistance. End of support may also be referred to as "end of life" or abbreviated "EOL". This is the time to make sure you have the latest available update installed.

Updates are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it. A device needs to install the latest update to remain supported. Updates may include new features, fixes (security and/or non-security), or a combination of both. Not all features in an update will work on all devices. Update availability may vary, for example by country, region, network connectivity, or hardware capabilities (including, for example, free disk space).
